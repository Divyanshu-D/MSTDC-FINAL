                    At a distance of 17 km from Jejuri and 65 km from Pune, Sri Moreshwar temple, also known as Sri
                    Mayureshwar Temple,
                    is a Hindu temple located at Moregaon in Pune district of Maharashtra. This temple is considered to
                    be the first temple among the
                    Ashta Vinayak temples of Lord Ganesha and also one of the popular places of pilgrimage in Pune.

                    The exact date of construction of the temple is unknown, though the Ganapatya saint Morya Gosavi is
                    known to be associated with it.
                    The temple flourished due to the patronage of the Peshwa rulers and descendants of Morya Gosavi.
                    The temple is built with black-stone and has four gates. The temple has four minarets and a 50 feet
                    tall wall around it.
